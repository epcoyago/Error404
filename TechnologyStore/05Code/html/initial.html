			  <td>A good desktop PC can be the solution for many users, because it is cheaper and easier to upgrade without having to buy a new computer. Plus, with all-in-ones, you can get the screen and the rest of the hardware in one well-designed, complete, ready-to-go package. Laptops are the best option for offices where employees work on files in the cloud, analyze data, program, surf the Internet and make video calls, since they offer them mobility to move from one place to another and work at any time.</td>
			  <td>The new paradigm of corporate printing. Leveraging the experience gained in industrial printing, Epson brings the new WorkForce Pro printers to the corporate and print outsourcing market.</td>
			  <td>To get the latest in technology, from smartphones, computers to televisions at a lower cost, it is important that users look for spaces such as fairs or anniversaries, where they can find greater benefits and discounts. Likewise, seek the advice of experts that allow you to identify your needs and choose a team that responds to them and adapts to your pocket.</td>
